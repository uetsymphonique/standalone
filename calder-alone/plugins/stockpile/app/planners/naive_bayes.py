    """Naive Bayes Planner
    The planner utilizes past operational history to execute operations while
    prioritizing likelihood of link (action) success. With sufficient local data, NB planner
    runs all operations in order of most to least effective links, while dropping
    links with insufficient likelihood of success.
    The NB Planner recieves the following parameters:
        - min_link_data: the minimum number of past instances of a link (actions) in existing past
        operational data necessary for planner to utilize its probability of success.
        Can be custom set by user in 
        \stockpile\data\planners\48e1a882-1606-4910-8f2d-2352eb80cba2.yml, default is 3.
        - debug: Boolean indicating whether planner should log link selection
        logic in DEBUG level system output. Defaults to False, can also be changed in
        .yml config.
        - delay_execution_links: list of link ids whose execution should be pushed back
        to atomic ordering and treated as insufficient data to improve operation ordering.
        Set in config.
        -  min_prob_link_success: minimum calculated likelihood of success necessary to
        run a link (action). Set in config. Default is 49%
    Algorithm:
        - While there are available link(s) in the operation for live agent(s):
            - If there are link(s) that satisfy minimum operational data settings and 
            minimum link probability of success settings:
                - Execute the link with the highest calculated probability of success
            - Else:
                - If there are remaining link(s) with insufficient past operational data:
                    - Execute next link based on atomic ordering
            - Drop any links that with sufficient past data but insufficient calculated
            probability of success
        - Terminate when out of links or all links have too low likelihood of success
